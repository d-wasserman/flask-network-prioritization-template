# flask-network-prioritization-template

A sample application using flask and leafet to enable dynamic changes to weights for an arbitrary multicriteria analysis. Inspired by Ian McHargs work on overlay analysis as a method of managing complexity and reflecting human values in planning for human settlement. 

# Summary

This sample project uses sample data from a priorization analysis for West Valley, Utah's Active Transportation Plan to provide an example of how to use flask for dynamically reweighting a multicriteria analysis.

Part of the motivation for this project is to start 2019 by celebrating the 50th aniversary of [Sir Ian McHarg's book "Design With Nature"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McHarg). This type of analytical implementation provides a template for open source McHargian style analysis to help planners design with data.
