# flask-network-prioritization-template


# Summary

This sample project uses sample data from a priorization analysis for West Valley, Utah's Active Transportation Plan to provide an example of how to use flask for dynamically reweighting a multicriteria analysis.

Part of the motivation for this project is to start 2019 by celebrating the 50th aniversary of [Sir Ian McHarg's book "Design With Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McHarg).This type of analytical tool provides a template for open source McHargian style analysis to help planners design with data.
